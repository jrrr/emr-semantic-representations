# Using Pre-Learned Semantic Representations of Biomedical Concepts for Analyzing Electronic Medical Records

This is the main code repository for my master's thesis "Using Pre-Learned Semantic Representations of Biomedical Concepts for Analyzing Electronic Medical Records". It uses two further repositories:

* https://github.com/jrrr/conceptfinder, a program for extracting biomedical concepts from text.
* https://github.com/jrrr/mimic3-benchmarks/tree/emr-semantic-representations, a fork of https://github.com/YerevaNN/mimic3-benchmarks which I used to split the MIMIC-III data set into patients and episodes, and get feature vectors of physiological measurements.
